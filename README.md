# How-Javascript-Works

Section 2: 
1. Javascript Engine:
    a. Parser 
    b. AST (tree)
    c. Interpreter & Compilers: Int.. reads the code line by line, Com .. takes the complete code, understand it and create a new type of code in a different language. Usually creates a machine code. They both of pros and cons when compiling the code. 
   The engineers build something which combines both interpreter and compilier into  called JIT Complier (just in time) in V8 engine.
