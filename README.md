# How-Javascript-Works

Section 2: 
1. Javascript Engine:
    a. Parser 
    b. AST (Abstract syntax tree)
    c. Interpreter & Compilers: Int.. reads the code line by line, Com .. takes the complete code, understand it and create a new type of code in a different language. Usually creates a machine code. They both of pros and cons when compiling the code. 
   The engineers build something which combines both interpreter and compilier into  called JIT Complier (just in time) in V8 engine.
   d. Profiler, watches the code and sees what we can do to optimise it, sees what code runs how many times. 
2. Bytecode: code interpreted by js engine to run.
